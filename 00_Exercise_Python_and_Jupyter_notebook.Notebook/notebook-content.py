# MARKDOWN ********************

# # Python + Jupyter exercises

# MARKDOWN ********************

#  1) Write a list (the python word for an array) called `my_movies_list` with your 4 favorite movies or tv series
#  Hints:
# - strings can have single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`
# - list have square brackets `[ ]`

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  2) Select the second and third element from your list
#  Hints:
# - python starts counting at 0, so the second element gets index number 1

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  3) Select the last element from your list
#  Hints:
# - the last element can be selected by using -1

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

# 
#  4) Write a (pythonic) for loop that loops through your movies list and prints them out
#  Hints:
# - use 4 space indentation or a tab as indentation (although Jupyter will give you this automatically)

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  5) Create a dictionary (key -  value pairs) called `my_movies_dict` with the same four movies as keys and for each movie add as a value the rating on a scale of 0 to 10 you would give it
#  Hints:
# - dictionaries use angular brackets, like this: `{}`
# - an example would be {'God Father': 3}

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  6) Use a for loop to print every movie and it's rating of your dictionary:
#  Hints:
# - using `for key in your_dict:` will iterate over all the keys in your dictionary
# - you can get a value from a dictionary, when you do: `your_dict['key_name']` this will return the value

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  7) Write a function called `rating_converter()` that takes as input a movie rating and multiplies it with 10 to convert your movie ratings to a scale of 1 to 100. The function should return the new movie rating.
#  Hints:
# - functions start with `def()`
# - what belongs inside a function should be indented by 4 spaces or a tab

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  8) Try tab completion on your rating_converter() function by writing only the first few letters for example `rat` and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> 
# If you use Jupyter of Jupyter Lab Google Colab, use here <kbd>Tab</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> 

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  9) In the next exercises we are going to read in data with `pd.read_csv()`. Type `import pandas as pd` to import pandas and after that `pd.read_csv()` below and see what happens when you do <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> inside the brackets of `pd.read_csv()`. You can see all the arguments then.
# If you use Jupyter of Jupyter Lab Google Colab, use here <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> 

# CELL ********************


# MARKDOWN ********************

#  10) Also try tab completion by only writing `pd.read_` and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>.
